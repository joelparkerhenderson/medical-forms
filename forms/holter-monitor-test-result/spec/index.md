# Holter Monitor Test Result — specification

This file is the **living domain spec** for this form. It captures the contract each implementation (SQL schema, generated representations, front-ends, and Rust backend) must satisfy. Treat it as the source of truth for behaviour — update the spec before changing code.

Slug: `holter-monitor-test-result`

## 1. Purpose

A UK NHS–aligned **ambulatory ECG (Holter) monitor result (report)** that a
reporting clinician completes after an ambulatory cardiac rhythm recording has
been performed and analysed. It is the **result/report counterpart** to *Holter
Monitor Test Request* (a referral): where the request captures why monitoring
should be done, this form records what the recording **found** and a structured
**interpretation**. It records the monitor type and recording quality, the
clinical history, the rhythm and rate summary (mean / minimum / maximum heart
rate, longest pause, ectopy burden), the structured and narrative findings, the
impression, and recommended follow-up — then computes a **four-axis
interpretation grade** (result classification, abnormality severity / structured
reporting, report completeness, and follow-up urgency) plus a set of
safety-critical flags including an automatic **critical-result alert**. The
output is a structured ambulatory ECG report.

This form is the ambulatory-cardiology result counterpart to the repository's
other clinician-driven result forms, and mirrors the *CT Scan Test Result* gold
template. It is completed by a cardiologist, cardiac physiologist, or other
reporting clinician rather than by the patient, and is aligned with ACC/AHA
ambulatory electrocardiography guidance, the 2017 ISHNE-HRS expert consensus on
ambulatory ECG and external cardiac monitoring, NICE NG196 atrial fibrillation
guidance, and ESC guidance on bradycardia / cardiac pacing and ventricular
arrhythmias.

## 2. Scope

In scope: the schema, scoring engine, four front-ends (form + dashboard, each in HTML and SvelteKit), and the Rust full-stack crate listed in §5. Out of scope: hosted deployment, authentication, multi-tenancy.

## 3. Scoring system

See [`index.md`](../index.md) for the scoring instrument, ranges, and categories applicable to this form.

`F-UNEXPECTED-FINDING-001` checked only atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and high-grade AV block — not a significant pause (> 3 s) — even though `hasSignificantPause` is one of `hasCriticalFinding`'s own four triggers. Fixed by adding `hasSignificantPause(r)` to the flag's predicate in both `js/flags.js` and `src/lib/engine/flagged-issues.ts`. Fixed 2026-09-06; previously verified and documented (not silently patched) in `examples/personas.json`.

## 4. Inputs and outputs

**Inputs.** A typed assessment object whose shape mirrors the SQL schema in `sql/` (8 migration files). Unanswered text and enum fields default to `''`; unanswered numeric, date, and time fields default to `null`.

**Outputs.** A grading object emitted by the engine: scoring result (per the instrument named in §3), `firedRules[]`, `additionalFlags[]`, and a clinical / administrative report. Rendered as HTML in the browser, exported as PDF via the SvelteKit endpoint, and convertible to FHIR R5 Bundle, XML, JSON, CSV, or TSV.

## 5. Artefacts

Required artefacts and their current status:

| Subdirectory | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `sql` | source of truth |
| `xml` | generated |
| `fhir` | generated |
| `protobuf` | generated |
| `openapi` | generated — not implemented |
| `front-end-with-html` | HTML + Lily (wizard + dashboard) — not implemented |
| `front-end-with-svelte` | SvelteKit (wizard + dashboard) |
| `back-end-with-loco` | Rust + Loco JSON API |

Generated artefacts (XML, FHIR R5, Protocol Buffers, OpenAPI, Loco setup script) are never hand-edited; re-run the generators in [`/AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) §Tools after schema changes.

## 6. Acceptance criteria

- `bin/test-form holter-monitor-test-result` exits cleanly.
- The scoring engine is pure (no side effects, no I/O) and unit-tested.
- The HTML front-ends conform to the Lily HTML headless contract
  ([`forms/AGENTS-front-end-html.md`](../../AGENTS-front-end-html.md)).
- The SvelteKit front-ends conform to the Lily Svelte headless contract
  ([`forms/AGENTS-front-end-svelte.md`](../../AGENTS-front-end-svelte.md))
  and pass `pnpm check` and `pnpm test`.
- The Rust crate builds (`cargo build`) and tests pass (`cargo test`).
- `bin/lily-html-refactor --check holter-monitor-test-result` reports no drift.
- LocalStorage keys preserve draft state across reloads:
  - `holter-monitor-test-result.front-end-with-html.v1` (HTML)
  - `holter-monitor-test-result.front-end-with-svelte.v1` (SvelteKit)

## 7. Compliance

Inherits the monorepo compliance baseline: MDCG 2019-11 Rev.1 (EU MDR), UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002, ISO/IEC/IEEE 26514:2022, UK MHRA Software and AI as a Medical Device. Form-specific classification (e.g. Class IIa where output drives clinical decisions) is recorded in [`index.md`](../index.md) and [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) where it differs from the baseline.
