# Blood Cross-Match Test Result — specification

This file is the **living domain spec** for this form. It captures the contract each implementation (SQL schema, generated representations, front-ends, and Rust backend) must satisfy. Treat it as the source of truth for behaviour — update the spec before changing code.

Slug: `blood-cross-match-test-result`

## 1. Purpose

A UK NHS–aligned **blood cross-match / transfusion compatibility result
(report)** that a reporting clinician completes after pre-transfusion testing has
been performed in the transfusion laboratory. It is the **result/report
counterpart** to *Blood Cross-Match Test Request* (a referral): where the request
captures why testing should be done and whether it is safe to proceed, this form
records what the testing **found** and a structured **interpretation**. It
records the ABO/RhD group, the antibody screen and any antibodies identified, the
crossmatch / compatibility outcome and component availability, the identity-safety
checks (two-sample group-check rule, historical-group concordance), special
component requirements, the overall result status, narrative findings, the
impression, and recommended follow-up — then computes a **four-axis
interpretation grade** (result classification, abnormality severity / structured
reporting, report completeness, and follow-up urgency) plus a set of
safety-critical flags including an automatic **critical-result alert**. The
output is a structured transfusion-compatibility report.

This form is the transfusion-compatibility result counterpart to the
repository's other clinician-driven result forms. It is completed by a biomedical
scientist, transfusion practitioner, or consultant haematologist rather than by
the patient, and is aligned with British Society for Haematology (BSH)
pre-transfusion compatibility guidance, NICE NG24 *Blood transfusion*, and the
Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) recommendations on positive patient
identification, the two-sample group-check rule, and the prevention of ABO-
incompatible transfusion and Wrong Blood in Tube (WBIT).

## 2. Scope

In scope: the schema, scoring engine, four front-ends (form + dashboard, each in HTML and SvelteKit), and the Rust full-stack crate listed in §5. Out of scope: hosted deployment, authentication, multi-tenancy.

## 3. Scoring system

See [`index.md`](../index.md) for the scoring instrument, ranges, and categories applicable to this form.

`hasAnyAbnormalFinding` (Axis A's classification predicate) did not check for a non-compatible crossmatch with special requirements recorded, so that combination classified `normal` on Axis A while Axis B graded it independently. Fixed by adding `(specialRequirements.trim() !== '' && crossmatchResult !== 'compatible')` to `hasAnyAbnormalFinding` in both `js/rules.js` and `src/lib/engine/utils.ts`. Fixed 2026-09-06; previously verified and documented (not silently patched) in `examples/personas.json`.

## 4. Inputs and outputs

**Inputs.** A typed assessment object whose shape mirrors the SQL schema in `sql/` (8 migration files). Unanswered text and enum fields default to `''`; unanswered numeric, date, and time fields default to `null`.

**Outputs.** A grading object emitted by the engine: scoring result (per the instrument named in §3), `firedRules[]`, `additionalFlags[]`, and a clinical / administrative report. Rendered as HTML in the browser, exported as PDF via the SvelteKit endpoint, and convertible to FHIR R5 Bundle, XML, JSON, CSV, or TSV.

## 5. Artefacts

Required artefacts and their current status:

| Subdirectory | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `sql` | source of truth |
| `xml` | generated |
| `fhir` | generated |
| `protobuf` | generated |
| `openapi` | generated — not implemented |
| `front-end-with-html` | HTML + Lily (wizard + dashboard) — not implemented |
| `front-end-with-svelte` | SvelteKit (wizard + dashboard) |
| `back-end-with-loco` | Rust + Loco JSON API |

Generated artefacts (XML, FHIR R5, Protocol Buffers, OpenAPI, Loco setup script) are never hand-edited; re-run the generators in [`/AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) §Tools after schema changes.

## 6. Acceptance criteria

- `bin/test-form blood-cross-match-test-result` exits cleanly.
- The scoring engine is pure (no side effects, no I/O) and unit-tested.
- The HTML front-ends conform to the Lily HTML headless contract
  ([`forms/AGENTS-front-end-html.md`](../../AGENTS-front-end-html.md)).
- The SvelteKit front-ends conform to the Lily Svelte headless contract
  ([`forms/AGENTS-front-end-svelte.md`](../../AGENTS-front-end-svelte.md))
  and pass `pnpm check` and `pnpm test`.
- The Rust crate builds (`cargo build`) and tests pass (`cargo test`).
- `bin/lily-html-refactor --check blood-cross-match-test-result` reports no drift.
- LocalStorage keys preserve draft state across reloads:
  - `blood-cross-match-test-result.front-end-with-html.v1` (HTML)
  - `blood-cross-match-test-result.front-end-with-svelte.v1` (SvelteKit)

## 7. Compliance

Inherits the monorepo compliance baseline: MDCG 2019-11 Rev.1 (EU MDR), UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002, ISO/IEC/IEEE 26514:2022, UK MHRA Software and AI as a Medical Device. Form-specific classification (e.g. Class IIa where output drives clinical decisions) is recorded in [`index.md`](../index.md) and [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) where it differs from the baseline.
